# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-and-Classification-Project
This repository showcases my CNN project with the Cats vs. Dogs, Horses vs. Humans, and Sign Language datasets. It covers building and improving classifiers, addressing overfitting, applying image augmentation, using transfer learning, and developing multi-class classifiers. Notebooks reflect my learning and model development.
